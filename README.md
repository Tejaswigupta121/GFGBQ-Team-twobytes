# Problem Statement
PS 03: AI Hallucination and Citation Verification System

Generative AI models are widely used for research, learning, and decision making. However, these models often generate factually incorrect information presented with high confidence. A critical extension of this problem is the creation of fake citations, non-existent references, and broken links, which appear legitimate but cannot be verified. This makes it difficult for users to trust AI-generated content and may lead to misinformation, legal risks, and ethical concerns.

Build a system that can detect, flag, and verify factual claims and citations generated by AI models, helping users distinguish between reliable and unreliable AI-produced information.

# 📄 Project Overview

**HalluciNOT** is an AI-powered system that detects hallucinations in AI-generated text by:

* Extracting factual claims
* Retrieving real-world evidence from indexed datasets (Wikipedia + internal corpus)
* Verifying claims using Natural Language Inference (BART-MNLI)
* Detecting fake or unverifiable citations
* Computing a transparent **Trust Score**
* Generating downloadable **JSON & PDF verification reports**

The goal is to **increase trust, accountability, and explainability** in AI-generated content.

# 📊 Trust Score Explanation

```
Trust Score = (Supported Claims / Total Claims) × 100
```

Color-coded interpretation:

* 🟢 **High Trust** (≥ 70%)
* 🟡 **Moderate Trust** (40–69%)
* 🔴 **Low Trust** (< 40%)
